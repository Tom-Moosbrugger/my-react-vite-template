# My React Vite Template

This repo contains a template for simple React projects. It consists of basic, boilerplate code that has the structure of a single-page React application. From this template, you have everything you need to start building your own React application!

## How to clone

To clone this repo, run the the following command:

```sh
npx tiged tom-moosbrugger/my-react-vite-template#main <new-project-name>
```

This command will create a clone of the repo' `main` branch under the name
<new-project-name> in the directory where it is run.

## Installing and running

Once the repo is cloned, cd into the root directory of your project and run the following command to install the dependencies

```sh

```

Then, run this command to start your app:

`npm run dev` runs the `dev` script from your __package.json__; you will run

## Personalization

To fully mark this project as your own, be sure to change the title of the project in a few of the files! 

Here are the files and sections to change: the title at the top of this README, the `title` of the __index.html__ file, and the `"name"` in the __package.json__.

Thanks for cloning and happy coding!
